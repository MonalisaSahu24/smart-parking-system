# 🅿️ IoT-Based Smart Parking System

An **IoT-based Smart Parking System** that automates parking slot detection using sensors and microcontrollers. It monitors **real-time slot availability**, controls **entry/exit gates**, and displays **parking status** to reduce congestion and improve efficiency.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Sensors detect the presence of vehicles in each slot.  
2. Microcontroller updates the slot availability on the display in real-time.  
3. Gates are automatically controlled based on availability.  
4. Alerts indicate when parking is full or nearly full.
